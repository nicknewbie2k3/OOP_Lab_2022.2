a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?

I dont think JAVA will allow it to be used, as both parameter uses the same datatype {String}, and it may be confusing
for the compiler to understand, for example DVD myDVD = new DVD("Comedy"); it wont be able to tell if its of the String of title of category type.
